  <h1>Nowhere Boy Slide Project</h1>
  <h6>ELA project on the book <i>Nowhere Boy</i> by Katherine Marsh.</h6>
  <h5>Perspective</h5>
  <pre>
    <i>he imagined how it must feel for him to hear the world outside—the shouts from the schoolyard,
      the planes overhead, the sirens and honks and construction noises—and know he couldn’t be part of it.
      Whatever Ahmed had seen, whatever he was afraid of being sent back to,
      had to have been horrible for him to prefer a life like this.</i>
      This is the author having the main character envision Ahmed's perspective which in turn can actually
      help the reader understand that Ahmed's life is really different and he has seen things.
      This quote helps the reader understand the characters more because it also shows how Max
      is being considerate and also taking Ahmed's perspective into account.
    <i>Ahmed would have to try; he had lost faith in his own.
    Would a Jewish organization really want to help a Muslim boy?
    They probably just resented the comparison between his plight and Ralph’s. 
    People were always weighing their suffering against others’,</i>
    This is an example of the author using author's craft.
    This is because the author is showing Ahmed's perspective which is one,
    and the author is showing Ahmed's questions and his thinking to
    signify what is happening and making the story more showcase
    Ahmed more.
