  <h1>Nowhere Boy Slide Project</h1>
  <h6>ELA project on the book <i>Nowhere Boy</i> by Katherine Marsh.</h6>
  <h5>Character Development</h5>
  <pre>
    <i>“Ahmed looked at the books Max brought him. It was easy enough to follow the Aquaman comic. The pictures helped”</i>
Max was very considerate for Ahmed and brought books that Ahmed could look at without needing to understand
the language.
Max is a very caring and nice character due to all his actions and commitment.
Max was like a refugee shelter, but his role was to help Ahmed who was a refugee.
The protagonist's perspective shifts when he finds Ahmed; <i>“Max stumbled backward. He was about to shout for help when 
the blanket rustled and a man emerged. He was muscular, with thick, dark eyebrows and the shadow of a mustache.”</i>
At that point he possibly didn't like refugees because he was hiding their but after seeing him and seeing that he was
a child like him he started acting more responsible and more logical.
