  <h1>Nowhere Boy Slide Project</h1>
  <h6>ELA project on the book <i>Nowhere Boy</i> by Katherine Marsh.</h6>
  <h5>Character Development</h5>
  <pre>
    <i>“Ahmed looked at the books Max brought him. It was easy enough to follow the Aquaman comic. The pictures helped”</i>
Max was very considerate for Ahmed and brought books that Ahmed could look at without needing to understand
the language.
Max is a very caring and nice character due to all his actions and commitment.
Max was like a refugee shelter, but his role was to help Ahmed who was a refugee.
The protagonist's perspective shifts when he finds Ahmed; <i>“Max stumbled backward. He was about to shout for help when 
the blanket rustled and a man emerged. He was muscular, with thick, dark eyebrows and the shadow of a mustache.”</i>
At that point he possibly didn't like refugees because he was hiding their but after seeing him and seeing that he was
a child like him he started acting more responsible and more logical.

<i>"“Is he home?” There was no need to ask who she was talking about. “Yeah. He’s fine.”  
“That’s great,” she said, but Max could detect a note of sarcasm. 
“What?” he asked. Claire took a deep breath. “You can’t keep hiding him.”
Max was surprised by how hurt he felt, as if she’d personally insulted him. “Yes, I can"</i> 
This shows how Max refuses to take his own family's advice to not keep hiding Ahmed
and Max felt as if he was insulted, it's part of his character of being determined and helping Ahmed in his journey.

<i>"He’d scored 13 out of 77, a score so low it almost didn’t seem possible"</i>
