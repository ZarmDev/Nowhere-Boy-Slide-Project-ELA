  <h6>ELA project on the book <i>Nowhere Boy</i> by Katherine Marsh.</h6>
  <h5 id="beginning">Beginning of the book</h5>
    <pre>
<<<<<<< HEAD
      Nowhere boy is an engrossing book with the prespectives of two boys, Ahmed and Max.
      Ahmed is a kind refugee and Max has been dragged off to Brussels by his parents because
      they are in searchfor a "better" place for Max. In Chapter 1, Ahmed's dad supposedly drowns and dies.
      Ahmed takes transportation via a smuggler, but this smuggler wanted more money than Ahmed
      had and tried to trap him in the car. However, Ahmed was able to escape and
      he bolted inside the first house he could find. This house happens to be the house Max, his parents, 
      and his sister are living in. Ahmed makes the cellar his home and tries to only steal
      what he absolutely needs, taking very little food from the kitchen. Almost as repayment,
      Ahmed tends to the the garden, and his work does not go unnoticed.
Max is very brave because he finds him and doesn't report him, he also is a nice kid
because he didn't discriminate.

Almost as repayment, Ahmed tends to the the garden, and his work does not go unnoticed. Soon, Max finds Ahmed, however, Max does not tell his parents or Inspector Fontaine about Ahmed because he is very curious and does not view Ahmed as a threat. From this point on, Max and Ahmed become great friends.

    <h5 id="middle">Middle</h5>
    <pre>In the middle of the book, Max gives food and helps Ahmed by giving him supplies.
      Farah is a girl who is Muslim and agreed to help with Max's plan.
      Oscar is a boy who bullied Max but eventually became his friend because Max punched him and they
      stopped getting so heated.
      Farah agrees to help Max out by calling as a "mom" of Ahmed and Oscar would make a passport,
      they did this because Ahmed would need a passport to go to school and Max was determined
      to help him.
      Farah does a phone call and Oscar prints the passport.
      They manage to get Ahmed in school, he also gets his own documentation.
    </pre>
    <h5 id="end">End</h5>
    <pre>Several problems arise in the end</pre>
    <ul>
      <li>Where will he (Ahmed) go when Max goes?</li>
      <li>What if someone inspects Ahmed</li>
      <li>What if the terrorist situation gets worse?</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>In the end, Ahmed flees because the teacher found Ahmed suspicious.
    Max in a attempt to find Ahmed, found a person close to Ahmed and Max found that Ahmed's dad
    was actually alive.
    Max finds Ahmed in a park and they go on a train to Hungary to find his dad as that was the location given.
    They get to Hungary but the police stop them and they have to get on a refugee service car
    but Ahmed got taken in.
    Ahmed finds his dad and reunites, better yet they are allowed to go out of the center 
    and get to America (Washington DC) which is where Max lives.
