  <h5>Ahmed's role in the historical context</h5>
  <pre>
    <i>“Who are you talking about?” Max asked gently. Ahmed turned to Max.
      It was too late to keep his mouth shut,
    to lock the story back up inside him. A part of him no longer even wanted to. 
    “We live in Aleppo,” he began. “You know Aleppo?” Max shook his head. 
    “Biggest city in Syria, very old. Home of Jami’ Halab al-Kabir,
    very famous old mosque. Also most big market bazaar in world.”</i>
    <i>Assad take over eastern part of Aleppo, and government army tries to take it back. 
      One morning, all calm. The next there is bomb, one street from our street.”</i>
    This quote helps represent lots of the historical context in Nowhere Boy.
    Ahmed explains how when he was younger he and his family lived in Aleppo but
    the situation got worse and they had to live under the fear of bombs.
    The setting of <i>Nowhere Boy</i> by Katherine Marsh is in 2015-2016, 
    whereas it talks about problems that were more prominent in the past, such as in the 1950s.
    For example, there is discrimination against Muslims such as Ahmed,
    because there are a few Muslim "terrorists"
    (who might not even be terrorists after all) and because of that,
    everyone thinks that Muslims are all 'bad' and there is major discrimination going on against them.
